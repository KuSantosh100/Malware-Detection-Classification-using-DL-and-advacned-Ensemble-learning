# Malware Detection + Classificationüëæüíª‚ò†Ô∏è
The increasing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to a growing concern in ensuring their security. Malware attacks on IoT devices can result in severe consequences, including data breaches, privacy violations, and system failures. This project report proposes a novel approach for detecting malware in cross-architecture IoT devices using deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).The proposed methodology involves extracting features from raw binary files using a CNN model, which is then fine-tuned to classify the malware samples. The CNN model is optimized using a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines the strengths of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). 

The model's performance is evaluated on a dataset comprising malware samples from various IoT devices, achieving an accuracy of 97%.

The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, outperforming existing methodologies in detecting malware in cross-architecture IoT devices. The model's robustness and adaptability to diverse malware samples highlight its potential as a valuable tool in IoT security. In conclusion, this project report presents a promising deep learning-based approach for detecting malware in cross-architecture IoT devices. The proposed model's high accuracy and adaptability to diverse malware samples make it a valuable contribution to the field of IoT security. Future work includes expanding the dataset to include more diverse and complex malware samples and exploring other deep learning architectures for malware detection in IoT devices.
